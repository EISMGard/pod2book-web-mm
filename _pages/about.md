The idea for transcribing podcasts to ebooks (pod2book) came about whilst listening to a podcast that was very scientific, with a lot of details. I wanted to capture what the person was saying and be able to go back and review, highlight, create notes, study, etc. Then came different podcasts I wanted to do the same thing with. Well, necessity being the mother of invention, I coded something on up and it worked pretty good.

I then thought to myself, "Self, this could also be valuable for other people that are neurodivergent, or just like to read." I also shared the idea with someone else, and they were like, "Oh yeah that would help people that are deaf or hard of hearing too." I wish I thought of that part myself.

Podcast transcripts are nice and all, but difficult to find and organize. What I would really like is to have a storefront/library that has all these podcasts-turned-eBooks organized by author that could then be subscribed to on your eBook reader of choice. Perhaps the eBooks could even be broken down into volumes like, Volume 1 would include episodes 1-50 and volume 2 would have episodes 51-100, etc.

Well, since I don't own the copyright to any of these, I didn't think it wise to try something like that. I shopped it around a little bit, then figured, what they hay, just open source it and let the people have at it and create their own libraries.
